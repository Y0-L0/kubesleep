# kubesleep

Save your development cluster one pod at a time.

*kubesleep* is a lightweight CLI utility that can **suspend** (scale to‚ÄØzero) and **wake** Kubernetes namespaces, saving cluster capacity by shutting down idle development and testing environments and restoring them on demand.

---

## üì¶ Installation

*kubesleep* is distributed as a static binary.

1. Navigate to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Y0-L0/kubesleep/releases/latest) page.
2. Download the archive that matches your operating system and architecture.
3. Extract the binary and move it somewhere on your `PATH`:

```bash
tar -xzvf kubesleep-linux-amd64.tgz
chmod +x kubesleep
sudo mv kubesleep /usr/local/bin/
```

Build from source:

```bash
go build -o /usr/local/bin/ ./cmd/...
```

> **Prerequisites**
>
> * A kubeconfig whose user or service‚Äëaccount has RBAC rights to interact with namespaces, ConfigMaps, Deployments, StatefulSets and CronJobs.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Suspend the dev namespace
kubesleep suspend --namespace dev

# Wake the namespace back up
kubesleep wake --namespace dev
```

Add `-v` or `-vv` to any command for info/debug logs.

## Common use‚Äëcases

### Wake

Wake up one or more previously suspended namespaces by restoring the replica counts recorded during the last successful `suspend` operation.

```bash
kubesleep wake -n dev
kubesleep wake -n dev -n staging -vv
```

You can also wake a namespace by redeploying your workloads to it (e.g., with `helm upgrade --install`). If you choose this option, delete the `kubesleep‚Äësuspend‚Äëstate` ConfigMap manually:

```bash
kubectl -n <your-namespace> delete configmap kubesleep-suspend-state
```

### Suspend

Suspend one or more namespaces by scaling workloads to zero and persisting their original replica counts in a state ConfigMap.

```bash
kubesleep suspend -n dev
kubesleep suspend -n dev -n staging
```

The operation is mostly idempotent and can be rerun to update the suspend state or to repeat a failed or aborted attempt.

See below for details about the suspend‚Äëstate merge behaviour.

#### Protected Namespaces

Certain Kubernetes namespaces are protected from accidental suspension: `default`, `kube-{system,public,node-lease}`, `ingress-nginx`, `istio`, `local-path`.

These namespaces are skipped unless you explicitly override the protection with the `--force` flag:

```bash
kubesleep suspend -n ingress-nginx --force
```

You can protect additional namespaces by annotating the namespace manifest with `kubesleep.xyz/do-not-suspend="true"`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubesleep.xyz/do-not-suspend: "true"
```

#### Periodic auto‚Äësuspension

Humans are forgetful. For development and testing clusters you may want to schedule an automatic suspension of all unprotected namespaces:

```bash
kubesleep suspend --all-namespaces
```

The `--all-namespaces` flag cannot be combined with `--force`.

## Merge semantics

The `kubesleep suspend` command can be repeated to:

* Resume a previously cancelled suspend operation.
* Retry a failed suspend operation.
* Redo a suspend operation after adding or modifying workloads with tools like `kubectl` or `helm`.

New workloads are added to the suspend state. Manual changes to `replicaCount` are **not** incorporated. The `wake` command always restores the initial replica counts, not any intermediate values. After a successful `wake`, the suspend state is reset (the ConfigMap is deleted).

**Example**

1. You suspend a workload, scaling it from 2 replicas to 0.
2. You manually scale it to 5 replicas with `kubectl`.
3. You suspend the namespace again.
4. You wake the namespace.

The workload is restored to 2 replicas (the original value), **not** to 5.

## Limitations

Running multiple concurrent suspend or wake operations on the same namespace can lead to undefined behavior and is not supported.
